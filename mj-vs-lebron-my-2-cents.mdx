We've seen lots of videos comparing MJ and Lebron with regards to Who is the NBA's GOAT. Some videos like the one above shows advanced statistics to determine who is the Greatest Player of All Time. The most common primary case for MJ is the 6 Championship Rings + 6 Finals MVP while for Lebron it is his longevity claiming the top spot in most career points and still doing highlight reels at year 20. So it all depends on the point of view of a person. If they treasure a bit shorter career with dominance over his peers then MJ is the GOAT for them but if they prefer someone who plays great basketball over a long period of time then Lebron it is.

MJ GOAT case
- 6 NBA Titles (In 6 Finals appearances, No Finals series reached Game 7, 6 Finals MVP)
- Won 7 consecutive scoring titles then retired from the NBA, came back then won another 3 straight scoring titles (basically a showcase of offensive dominance over his peers)
- Highest Career Points per Game in NBA History
- Highest PER (Player Efficiency Rating) in NBA History
- Won a Defensive Player of the Year
- 9 All-Defense First Team
- 3 steals title

Lebron GOAT case
- Leader in Total Points
- Has higher Rebound and Assist average than Jordan
- Most number of NBA All-Star seasons
- Still playing at a high level despite being at year 21
- Has 10 NBA Finals Appearances (though losing 6 of those)

So basically it is about shorter dominance vs great longer career. Which type of career will you pick?

I'd pick Jordan not just because of the points mentioned above but also due to some intangibles.

Based on the image above screen grabbed from this [site](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/steals-per-game-each-decade-nba), it shows that the steals and blocks per game are dwindling down per decade. The same goes to Free Throws Made and Attempted. These basically shows the difference in eras. The players in the 80's and 90's plays more defense because the game is being played mostly within the painted area or the perimeter while as decade goes by teams make more outside shots as shown on the increasing 3pt attempts. And because in the 80s and 90s most points are closer to the rim, players are a bit closer to one another as compared to the recent seasons where teams are spreading out and maximizing the court. 

What does this have to do with MJ vs Lebron comparison? MJ played in the era where players are more physical with one another so MJ has to be more creative and needs a lot of skills to dominate a more physically demanding era. Where Lebron is in the era where shooting is prioritized as teams are expanding their shooting spots. But this also has to do with how NBA is maximizing their players for profit. If the game is less physical, they're subjected to less wear and tear and may probably has lesser injuries during their careers which extends their playing seasons which includes longer fanbase for the NBA. With this you can say that Jordan played in a more physically demanding era while Lebron played in a less physically demanding one. 
Softer era can result in longer playing seasons. Since there are more outside shooting attempts, players are more spread out making it easier for non-center players to get a rebound because the ball bounces further from the rim and most power forwards or even centers are also trying to stretch out. While during the 80's and 90's since the shots are closer to the rim most rebounds fall unto the hands of big men who are lurking in the painted area. So if you bring Lebron to the 80's and 90's era, will he also be able to get the same number of rebounds or will he need more rest to handle the physicality. While if you bring Jordan to today's era, he can dominate further because there's more space for him to operate so double teaming or triple teaming will be harder now than before because players are spread out unlike before once you go to the painted area power forwards and centers are there to defend you. So I guess Jordan will dominate more if he's in the era of today while Lebron might have lesser efficiency in the 80s.
Knowing that Jordan's time is more physically demanding, he played all 82 games of a season in 9 out of his 15 seasons while Lebron only played all 82 games in a season just ONCE. This means that Lebron despite playing in less physically-demanding era played lesser games per year while Jordan played all 82 games 9 out of 15 seasons, scoring champion for 10 out of 15 seasons, having All-NBA Defense First team for 9 out of 15 seasons basically saying that he dominated the league in both scoring and defending while also playing all 82 games of a season most of those playing years resulting to no NBA Finals series loss. This simply means NBA DOMINANCE without LOAD MANAGEMENT.

But then if one sees Lebron's longevity, getting a championship ring in 3 different teams, being the number in total career points and a few more accolades as a case in being the GOAT it's nothing to be completely ignored. Yes he is bigger allowing him to have more rebounds than MJ, he played in a positionless era which allows even a forward like him to also be a point guard which means you will generate the most number of assist for your team too. Lebron extended his shooting range as he adjusted due to the current style of play. He may not be as skilled as Jordan but he is smart in a way that he takes care of his longevity by not playing all 82 games of the season as much as Jordan or players during that older era do. He makes sure that his body is well taken care of so he's investing a lot on his body care not to mention that medical science has vastly improved meaning players in general are more taken cared of during Lebron's era. So Lebron played his cards well, he's bigger than MJ so he knows he can get an edge in rebounding and assisting. He knows that he is not as elite in scoring as MJ did, he doesn't have more consistent jumpshot, he doesn't have an elite dribbling skills maybe because his body is not built that way. Players his size can be powerful and fast but not the type who can do acrobatic dunks or layups and he knows that so why handle the scoring yourself if you can facilitate more instead. The NBA pace became faster too in average meaning more other stats to go around like the rebounds and assists. Being a facilitator also means additional assists so basically he collected the stats that he can be effective in acquiring. Why be a scoring killer like MJ if that requires more skill and finesse while your body is built more like a speeding tank. He's just basically maximizing what he can based on the body he was given. 
The NBA is more lucrative as well after Jordan's popularity made it global and that meant there are more strategies in play and one of those include more players being moved from one team to another. The talent has also grown as international talents flocked the NBA, more training camps and proper methods are more available to a wider audience. The movement of players are being seen as a downside by basketball purists and that diminished the GOAT case of Lebron as he has known as someone who recruits players or join them in order to win a ring. But this is just him being smart as he looked for a way to win a championship in a more efficient way given his skillset. He's not an elite scorer so he realized that he needs to assemble the best team possible to win a championship. And again this is him being smart identifying his strenghts and weaknesses but this meant he needs to look for players that can fit well with his style so what he has looked for a team that has good role players that can defend well, 3-point specialists (ray allen, irving, love, kcp etc), a guard that can score at a high level (Wade and Kyrie) and a big man that can score efficiently too with both inside and outside scoring (Bosh, Love and Davis). But that also limits his championship chances because he will have to rely on the talent of others whereas all Jordan needs are a bunch of players who can hold their positions well which is easier to find as the team management don't need to look for elite scorers, they just need solid players that are willing to support Jordan but they don't have to be a great scorer as Jordan filled up that up already. Lebron's team are stacked and they have to trade away future draft picks in place of those great teammates. But this shows that he's basically trying to get that championship ring in whatever way he can and those are smart moves.

So basically in summary, both of them tried their best in getting the ring depending on their capabilities. MJ is an elite scorer and defender while Lebron did it differently by approaching the game more smarter and not relying with elite skills as much but rather tried to look for (or assemble) teammates that will compliment his game and took care of his body for him to be able to stay in the NBA longer. For me MJ is my GOAT as I value his sheer dominance over his peers by simply outperforming them in both sides of the court without doing load management.
